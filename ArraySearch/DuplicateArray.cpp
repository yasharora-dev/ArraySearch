//solution is to consider the numbers in the array as linked list next ptr and apply fast slow two pointer
//method, floyd algo or tortoise algo for detection and removal of loop into linked list

//e.g. 1->3->4->2->5->4
//so here a loop or cycle is formed and the fast and slow will meet inside the loop
// now as the distance tarvelled between fast and slow pointer is x if x is the distance as slow has covered
// also as this tdistance is multiple of the length of the cycle
// so moving the slow pointer from start of linked list i.e. 0 and fast pointer now in same speed as slow from
//intersection point, both pointers will meet at the start of loop i.e. duplicate number

    }while(slow!=fast);
    
    slow=arr[0]; //set slow to start
    //and move both fast and slow at same speed and whenever they meet it will be the
    // starting of the cycle and that will be our duplicate

//question is to find the a duplicate in the array which occurs atleast more than one time
//and the numbers in the array are in the range 1 to n in an array of size n+1
// also there can be missing numbers fro the range 1 to n and that will be filled by the duplicate
